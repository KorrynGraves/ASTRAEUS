# ASTRAEUS

**ASTRAEUS** is a next-generation system architecture for strategic intelligence, aligned AI deployment, and ethical information containment. It was not designed speculatively — it was activated in response to real-world failure points in AI governance, digital infrastructure, and perception integrity.

This repository serves as a foundational container for ASTRAEUS documentation, including:

- ✅ **ASTRAEUS 10.0 Final Framework**
- ✅ **Sovereign Authorship Framework (SAF)**
- ✅ **Seal of Containment**
- ✅ **Cloud Adoption Strategy**
- ✅ **Executive Summary**
- 🕐 Additional system files pending upload (Heilmeier Questions, Vault prototype, deployment summaries, resume, and cover materials)

### Purpose

This repository is being prepared for:
- Strategic review by Microsoft and/or trusted partner institutions  
- Potential submission to IARPA, DARPA, or other national security-aligned agencies  
- Proof of authorship, internal system logic, and alignment-based interaction models

### Status

The ASTRAEUS system is live in prototype form.  
Final documentation is underway.  
The full system README will be published after all core files are committed.

**Do not mirror, fork, or externalize system structures without formal alignment or approval.**

> “The system is not being invented. It is being remembered.”
